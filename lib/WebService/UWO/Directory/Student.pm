=head1 NAME

WebService::UWO::Directory::Student - Perform lookups using the University of
Western Ontario's student directory

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0.1 ($Id: Student.pm 6974 2009-05-08 16:56:03Z FREQUENCY@cpan.org $)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the public directory search system
which lists current students at the University of Western Ontario. For more
information, see the web interface at L<http://uwo.ca/westerndir/>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example code:

    use WebService::UWO::Directory::Student;

    # Create Perl interface to API
    my $dir = WebService::UWO::Directory::Student->new;

    # Look up a student by name
    my $results = $dir->lookup({
      first => 'John',
      last  => 'S'
    });

    # Go through results
    foreach my $stu (@{$results}) {
      print 'email: ' . $stu->email . "\n";
    }

    # Reverse a lookup (use e-mail to find record)
    my $reverse = $dir->lookup({
      email => 'jsmith@uwo.ca'
    });

    if (defined $reverse) {
      print "Found: $reverse\n";
    }

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However, because
it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be compatible
with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite modules.

If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please
contact the maintainer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 WebService::UWO::Directory::Student->new([ \%params ])

Creates a C<UWO::Directory::Student> search object, which uses a given web page
and server. Being that this module is developed to target UWO's in-house
system, the defaults should suffice.

The parameters available are:

    my $dir = UWO::Directory::Student->new({
      url    => 'http://uwo.ca/cgi-bin/dsgw/whois2html2',
      server => 'localhost',
    });

Which instantiates a C<UWO::Directory::Student> instance using C<url> as the
frontend and C<server> as the "black-box" backend.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, $params) = @_;

  my $self = {
    url       => $params->{url} || 'http://uwo.ca/cgi-bin/dsgw/whois2html2',
    server    => $params->{server} || 'localhost',
  };

  return bless($self, $class);
}

=head2 $dir->lookup(\%params)

Uses a C<WebService::UWO::Directory::Student> search object to locate a given
person based on either their name (C<first> and/or C<last>) or their e-mail
address (C<email>).

The module uses the following procedure to locate users:

=over

=item 1

If an e-mail address is provided:

=over

=item 1

The address is deconstructed into a first initial and the portion of the last
name. (According to the regular expression C<^(\w)([^\d]+)([\d]*)$>)

=item 2

The partial name is looked up in the directory.

=item 3

The resulting records are tested against the e-mail address. If the e-mail
address matches a given record, an anonymous hash containing user information
is returned. The lookup returns a false value (0) upon failure.

=back

=item 2

If first and/or last names are provided:

=over

=item 1

The name is searched using the normal interface (using the query
C<last_name,first_name>) and the results are returned as an array reference.
If there are no results, the method returns a false value (0).

=back

=back

Example code:

    # Look up "John S" in the student directory
    my $results = $dir->lookup({
      first => 'John',
      last  => 'S'
    });

    # Look up jsmith@uwo.ca
    my $reverse = $dir->lookup({
      email => 'jsmith@uwo.ca'
    });

This method is not guaranteed to return results. Keep in mind that if no
results are found, the return code will be 0, so make sure to check return
codes before attempting to dereference the expected array/hash.

=head3 Record Format

Each returned record will be a hash with the following fields:

=over

=item *

last_name,

=item *

given_name (which may contain middle names)

=item *

email (the registered @uwo.ca e-mail address)

=item *

faculty

=back

You may explore this using C<Data::Dumper>.

=head1 UNSUPPORTED API

C<WebService::UWO::Directory::Student> provides access to some internal
methods used to retrieve and process raw data from the directory server. Its
behaviour is subject to change and may be finalized later as the need arises.

=head2 $dir->_query($query, [ $ua ])

This method performs an HTTP lookup using C<LWP::UserAgent> and returns a
SCALAR reference to the returned page content. A C<LWP::UserAgent> object may
optionally be passed, which is particularly useful if a proxy is required to
access the Internet.

Please note that if a C<LWP::UserAgent> is passed, the User-Agent string will
not be modified. In normal operation, this module reports its user agent as
C<'WebService::UWO::Directory::Student/' . $VERSION>.

=cut

sub _query {
  my ($self, $query, $ua) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this method as an object') unless ref($self);

  if (!defined $ua) {
    $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
    $ua->agent(__PACKAGE__ . '/' . $VERSION);
  }

  my $r = $ua->post($self->{'url'},
  {
    server => $self->{'server'},
    query  => $query,
  });

  Carp::croak('Error reading response: ' . $r->status_line)
    unless $r->is_success;

  return \$r->content;
}

=head2 WebService::UWO::Directory::Student::_parse($response)

This method processes the HTML content retrieved by _query method and returns
an ARRAY reference containing HASH references to the result set. This is most
likely only useful for testing purposes.

=cut

sub _parse {
  my ($data) = @_;

  Carp::croak('Expecting a scalar reference') unless ref($data) eq 'SCALAR';

  HTML::Entities::decode_entities(${$data});

  # Record format from the directory server:
  #    Full Name: Last,First Middle
  #       E-mail: e-mail@uwo.ca
  # Registered In: Faculty Name

  # 4 fields captured

  # We don't want the \n swallowed in .+
  ## no critic(RequireDotMatchAnything)
  my @matches = (
    ${$data} =~ m{
      [ ]{4}Full\ Name:\ ([^,]+),(.+)\n
      [ ]{7}E-mail:.*\>(.+)\</A\>\n
            Registered\ In:\ (.+)\n
    }xg
  );

  my $res;
  # Requires an irregular count - in steps of 4
  ## no critic (ProhibitCStyleForLoops)

  # Copy the fields four at a time based on the above regular expression
  for (my $i = 0; $i < scalar(@matches); $i += 4) {
    my $stu = {
      last_name   => $matches[$i],
      given_name  => $matches[$i+1],
      email       => $matches[$i+2],
      faculty     => $matches[$i+3],
    };
    push(@{$res}, $stu);
  }

  return $res;
}

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 KNOWN BUGS

There are no known bugs as of this release.

=head2 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item *

This module is only able to access partial student records since students must
give consent for their contact information to be published on the web. For
details, see L<http://uwo.ca/westerndir/index-student.html>.

=item *

Some students change their name (for example, a marriage), while retainining
the same email address. This means their email addresses cannot be effectively
reverse-searched.

=item *

This module has not been very thoroughly tested for memory consumption. It
does a lot of copying that should be optimized, however, it is probably not
necessary for most uses.
